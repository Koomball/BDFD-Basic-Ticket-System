# BDFD-Basic-Ticket-System
Basic button based ticket system.

## dev/setTicketPanel
unlike the other command in this guide this one will be a text trigger set in this example as `dev/setTicketPanel` but you can name this whatever you want. <br>
<br>
This command will display the panel users will use to open tickets you can place this anywhere in your server like your rules channel. <br>
The reasom we use a text trigger here is so the ticket panel doesnt display who used the command and makes for a more seamless look.
